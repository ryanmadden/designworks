# DesignWorks Landing Page

[Check it out!](https://ryanmadden.github.io/designworks)

This is a prototype landing page for DesignWorks's website. DesignWorks is a Northwestern student-run design company. I built this page to explore possibilities for their new website. It's nice and responsive so shrink your browser or try it on your phone. As always, development is ongoing. 

The loading animation is a fun little piece of CSS. Rotating and aligning the triangles was a little tedious, but the big issue came with the animation. It turns out that Chrome and Firefox don't play by the same rules when it comes to rotation in CSS which ended up being a big headache. 

In the future I'd like to try recreating this without help from Bootstrap. I took this project from zero to live in three days so having things like a responsive grid system and modal components was really nice. However, I think I could recreate the tools I've used and eleminate the overhead that Bootstrap causes.

Enjoy!

### Stuff used to make this:

 * [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for responsive columns and components
 * [HTML5 Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/) to jumpstart the project with Modernizr and Boostrap
 * [NUPSD Site](http://cargocollective.com/nupsd) for past artwork from DesignWorks designers
